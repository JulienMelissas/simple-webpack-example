# Simple Webpack Example
A simple webpack config for my SyntaxCon 2017 talk https://slides.com/julienmelissas/frontend-workflows-webpack/

## Installing
You need to have a newer version of node 6+ installed, with npm and yarn...

Grab your dependencies:
`$ yarn install`

Run your build:
`$ yarn build`

(you'll need to be serving the index.html file from something üëç)

## By no means is this ever a good production webpack build configuration (it's just to illustrate a simple config)!!
